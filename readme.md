# Glyphview Metrics HUD Extension

by Jackson Showalter-Cavanaugh (www.okaytype.com)

This extension needs a better name. It adds a UI to the bottom of the glyphview window to adjust the metrics. 

The buttons are a little cryptic:
➖➕ Add or subtract 5 from left/right or 10 from width
▞ The John Downer Button™ rounds the value to 5
↔︎ Center on width
→← Copy value from the other side

And this is useful: If you have a component, the tool will add buttons copy that baseglyph's metrics. The button turns green if they already match.
